Solidity Lottery Contract (Educational Purposes Only)
SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

Introduction:

This document provides a basic understanding of a Solidity contract designed for a lottery system. 
Important note: This code is for educational purposes only and should not be used in a real-world lottery due to its lack of secure randomness generation.

Contract Functionality:

Manages a lottery where participants pay an entry fee (1 Ether in this example).
Stores participant addresses in an array.
Allows the contract manager to:
View the current contract balance.
Select a winner (uses an insecure random number generation method).
After selecting a winner:
Transfers the entire contract balance to the winner.
Resets the participants list for the next round.

Key Points:

Insecure Randomness: The random function uses a combination of block variables and participant count, 
which is not a secure way to generate random numbers. This makes the winner selection process vulnerable to manipulation.
Limited Functionality: This is a simplified example and lacks features needed for a real-world lottery,
such as secure random number generation, participant verification, and proper error handling.

Disclaimer:

This code should never be used in a real-world lottery due to its security vulnerabilities. 
It's intended for educational purposes only to demonstrate the basic structure of a lottery contract.
Integrating a secure random number generation mechanism like Chainlink VRF is essential for a reliable and trustworthy lottery system.

Remember:

Always thoroughly test smart contracts in a secure environment before deploying them to the mainnet.
Security is paramount when dealing with real-world applications involving financial transactions.
